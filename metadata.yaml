  This mod provides an in-game GUI for adjusting mech livery parameters. Go to the base's livery selection menu, click the new "sliders" button to toggle on the new GUI. Select a starting livery. Type in a new name, and click the 'clone' button (the 2x2-grid-with-a-plus-sign). Adjust the sliders. Click the 'save' button. There is also a button for 'reset to last saved version of this livery'.
