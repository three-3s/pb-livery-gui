name: Livery GUI - Edit mech colors & materials
desc: >-
  Adds a livery editor that lets you customize livery colors and material properties, save them as new liveries, and apply them to your mechs.


  Go to the "mech paint" part of the base, and click on the new "sliders" button. Choose a livery to start from, give it a new name and click Save or Clone button. Adjust the sliders to your liking. Remember to Save any changes to your livery. (There's also a Reset button.)
